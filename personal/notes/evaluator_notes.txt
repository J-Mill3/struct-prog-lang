Simple order
1. identify operator
2. decide on operands
3. *evaluate operands
4. execute the operator

* sometimes you don't pre-evaluate something (like in an if)

Improved order
1. identify operator
2. decide on operands
3. evaluate initial operands
4. execute the operator, evaluate lazy operands if need

*Lazy evaluation

Conditions for successful recursion:
    1. a condition under which the answer is trivial and non-recursive (exit condition)
        - is there an exit condition?
    2. the problem you solve with recursion has to be smaller than the overall problem
        - is it getting smaller?

The parser builds the AST
The AST holds the order/precedence of the operations
The evaluator just recursively executes the operations in the AST

*Parentheses don't get added to the AST. They are processed by the parser which changes
 how the AST is constructed, but they aren't in the tree
